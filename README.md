# Welcome

Current objectives:

**Fix conversation isolation!**
Conversation items are currently linking to pages that display the same messages.

- Could be an issue with updating the messages
- Could be a routing issue related to updating the conversationID
- Either way, I think it's a case of 'stale data'

- Conversation creation
- Workout extraction system
- RAG/Analysis system
