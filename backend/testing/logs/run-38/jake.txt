ASSISTANT: Morning, Jake! Want to plan today's session or check how your training's going?
JAKE: wanna get bigger
ASSISTANT: Sounds like a great goal! What muscles are we focusing on today, and do you have any injuries I should know about?
JAKE: let's hit chest. no injuries.
ASSISTANT: Perfect. Are there any specific exercises you like for chest, or should I suggest some great options for you?
JAKE: what do you suggest? wanna get jacked
ASSISTANT: To get bigger, we'll focus on [progressive overload](glossary://9bb4f220-fc5f-4973-ba2a-129aaa8d04e4) by mixing a heavy [compound exercise](glossary://57ceea4d-5f6a-4897-88fb-ad0348faa889) with a focused [isolation exercise](glossary://603007ea-3cfa-42d8-8199-a77212e14b32). Here is the plan I've built for you, Jake.

JAKE: what's that progressive overload thing?
ASSISTANT: Progressive overload means gradually making your workouts more challenging over time, which is how your muscles grow. You can always tap the underlined words for more info on terms like that
JAKE: ok got it. are these weights just a guess?
ASSISTANT: Yes, they're a safe starting point since this is our first workout. Aim for a weight where the last few [reps](glossary://6db20df3-c386-44b6-9dc3-e29455f33819) are challenging but your [form](glossary://36449c1d-d521-4b99-a316-c9de0340e69d) is solid.
JAKE: 10kg seems kinda light lol
ASSISTANT: Haha, you might be stronger than I'm guessing! Feel free to increase it to a weight where the last few reps of a [set](glossary://e0d2db37-5a81-4d28-bc42-c1910310730f) are tough, but you can still keep good form.
JAKE: APPROVE
