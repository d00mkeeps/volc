ASSISTANT: Hey Sarah, morning! I can help plan a workout, analyze your progress, or talk recovery.
SARAH: Morning. Had shoulder surgery 6 months ago.
ASSISTANT: Good morning! Thanks for letting me know about your shoulder surgery. Have you been cleared for exercise, and are there any movements you need to avoid?
SARAH: Yeah, I'm cleared. No restrictions now.
ASSISTANT: Great to hear you're cleared. What are your main goals right now, and what did you have in mind for today's workout?
SARAH: Goal is to rebuild my strength. Full body workout today?
ASSISTANT: Sounds like a great plan. To rebuild strength, are there any particular exercises you like to do for a full body day?
SARAH: Usually squats, bench, and some kind of row.
ASSISTANT: Those are excellent foundational lifts. To give your shoulder extra support, how about we use a [chest press machine](glossary://8668c66d-4a15-429e-9c49-a85b8166d61f) instead of the barbell bench for now?
SARAH: Yeah, we can do that.
ASSISTANT: Perfect. Here is a full body session for you, Sarah, to get you started on rebuilding that strength.
