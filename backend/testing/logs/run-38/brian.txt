ASSISTANT: Morning, Brian! Want to plan today's session or check how your training's going?
BRIAN: Plan today.
ASSISTANT: Sounds good! What muscles are we hitting today, and are there any injuries I should know about?
BRIAN: Upper body. Back and knees. No restrictions.
ASSISTANT: Got it. Just to clarify, when you mention your back and knees, is that something you want to strengthen, or an issue I should know about?
BRIAN: Just something to know.
ASSISTANT: Thanks for confirming. Are there any specific exercises you like to include for an upper body day, or should I suggest some classics for you?
BRIAN: Need work on chins.
ASSISTANT: Excellent, we'll make chin-ups a priority. I'll build out the rest of your upper body session around that, sound good?
BRIAN: Sounds good.
ASSISTANT: Alright Brian, here is your upper body workout focused on building those chin-ups.
