REASONING: The user mentioned their doctor advised them to be more active. While this is important contextual information for their motivation, it doesn't provide a specific, actionable, or enduring fact to store in memory. The assistant's follow-up question acknowledges this lack of detail. Therefore, no new notes are added, and existing notes remain unchanged as no new relevant information has been introduced or contradicted.

REASONING: The user provided new information about their fitness goals and available equipment. Their doctor recommended increased activity for bone density and balance, which establishes their primary goals. They also specified having a yoga mat and 2kg dumbbells at home. The existing note 'Prefers to train at home' is implicitly confirmed but no explicit restatement occurred, so its date won't be updated. The 'beginner' note from the original memory also remains unchanged as it wasn't discussed. The category for 'beginner' has been changed from 'profile' to 'general' to fit the allowed categories.

REASONING: The user indicated that the workout provided was 'very complicated' and specifically mentioned being unsure about the first exercise, which suggests a preference for simpler movements or a need for more approachable instructions. They also asked for a definition of 'dumbbells', confirming a low familiarity with exercise equipment. This reinforces the 'beginner' status. The doctor's recommendation for bone density and balance is a new goal. The user also confirmed having a sturdy chair for exercise. I will add notes for the new goal, the available equipment, and the preference for simpler exercises, and update the dates for existing confirmed notes.

REASONING: The user revealed several new pieces of information. The doctor's recommendation to be more active and the specific focus on bone density and balance are new goals/health objectives. The available equipment (chairs and a wall) is new and specifies the home training environment. The creaky knees are a new physical limitation/injury, which was further refined to clarify no real pain, just noise when standing. The preference to train at home was reconfirmed by the discussion about available home equipment, so its date should be updated.

REASONING: The user reconfirmed their preference for home training by stating they don't have gym equipment. They also revealed a new physical consideration: needing to be careful with balance, which is a key limitation for exercise selection. Finally, they specified their available equipment as a 'sturdy chair'. The previous 'profile' category for beginner status will be changed to 'general' as per instructions. The doctor's advice to be more active is a motivation but not a memory note as it's too general. The explanation of 'glutes' is conversational and not a fact to store about the user.

REASONING: The user struggled with understanding the '90/90 Hip Stretch' and found it confusing, preferring a simpler movement like 'Cat-Cow' (which was ultimately swapped for 'Butterfly Stretch'). This indicates a preference for exercises that are easy to understand and perform, without complex instructions. This is a new preference related to exercise selection.

REASONING: The user's doctor recommended focusing on bone density and balance, which establishes a new goal. The user also specified their available equipment: small pink hand weights and a chair. They confirmed they have no injuries or medical restrictions. Finally, the user expressed confusion and intimidation regarding exercise names (e.g., 'Romanian Deadlift'), indicating a preference for simpler explanations.

REASONING: The user revealed that their doctor recommended improving bone density and balance, which are new goals. They also confirmed they have no gym equipment, reinforcing and specifying their home training preference. Crucially, the user stated they haven't done any real exercise in years, which significantly elaborates on their beginner status and implies a very low baseline fitness level, suggesting a need for extremely gentle and clear instructions for exercises. The difficulty expressed with push-ups (even incline) further supports this need for foundational, easily perceived exercises. I will combine the existing beginner note with the new information about inactivity. The 'prefers to train at home' note will be updated with the equipment context. New notes for bone density, balance goals, and the user's perception of exercise difficulty/need for foundational movements will be added.

REASONING: The user has provided several new pieces of information. They want to feel better and be more active, a recommendation from their doctor. They have poor balance, which is a physical limitation. They also confirmed they have no fitness equipment at home. Finally, the user's name, Margaret, was mentioned.

REASONING: The user revealed that their doctor recommended they become more active due to concerns about bone density and balance.

REASONING: The user explicitly stated they have no injuries or restrictions, which is a new piece of information to record. Additionally, the user requested more bicep exercises, indicating a preference for adequate bicep volume in their arm workouts. I will add a new note for each of these facts.

REASONING: The user revealed their name is Jake and that their primary goal is muscle hypertrophy ('getting jacked'). They are also actively learning about and planning to apply the principle of progressive overload in their training. They also explicitly stated they plan to train upper body tomorrow. The existing notes are still valid. The 'profile' category is not in the allowed list, so 'User is a beginner, with less than 2 years training experience.' will be moved to the 'general' category.

REASONING: The user explicitly stated 'nope all good' when asked about injuries, which is a new piece of information to add to the memory. The user also asked 'is this gonna be enough to get big?', indicating a primary goal of muscle hypertrophy. When offered to add another exercise, the user accepted, suggesting a preference for sufficient training volume (more than 3 exercises for chest) to achieve their hypertrophy goal. I will add notes for no injuries, the hypertrophy goal, and the preference for training volume.

REASONING: The user explicitly stated 'No restrictions' in response to an injury inquiry. This is new information indicating no current injuries or limitations. I will add this as a new note under the 'injury' category. The user also specified 'Chest and back' for tomorrow's workout. While this is a near-term plan, it represents a preference for the upcoming training session and will be added under the 'preference' category.

REASONING: The user explicitly stated, 'Need work on my overhead press,' indicating a specific focus for their training.

REASONING: The user confirmed they are a beginner and prefers to train at home without equipment. They also revealed that their doctor recommended activity due to bone density and balance concerns. A significant new fact is that the user found the initial workout with multiple exercises overwhelming and prefers to start with a single exercise (glute bridge). I will update the date for the beginner note, combine the home training preference with the lack of equipment into a single, more specific preference note, and add new notes for the doctor's recommendations and the user's preference for simpler initial workouts.

REASONING: The user indicated they needed 'work on the dips' and then explicitly requested to 'swap them' when offered an easier variation or a complete swap. This suggests a current preference to avoid or replace dips in their workouts. This is a new preference note.

REASONING: The user's doctor recommended they be more active, specifically mentioning bones and balance. This indicates a health focus. The user confirmed they have a kitchen chair, which is new equipment information and implicitly reconfirms their preference to train at home. I will add notes for the health focus and the equipment, and update the date for the 'prefers to train at home' note.

REASONING: The user expressed a desire to swap out specific exercises due to needing 'work' on them. First, they swapped 'Barbell Bent Over Row' for 'Machine Seated Chest Supported Row', indicating a preference for machine-supported rowing movements. Second, they swapped 'Bodyweight Pullup' for 'Cable Lat Pulldown', indicating a preference for machine-assisted vertical pulling movements, likely to better control form or target muscles. These are new preferences to add to memory.

REASONING: The user initially requested a pull day workout. They then indicated an issue with their chin-up form and subsequently decided to substitute chin-ups with lat pulldowns. This reveals a current training challenge with chin-up form and a preference for substituting exercises when form is an issue. This is a new behavioral preference influencing exercise selection.

The user also indicated a preference for a very gradual start by asking to begin with just one exercise, refining the existing 'beginner' profile. The 'train at home' preference was implicitly reconfirmed by the availability of a chair/wall. I will update the dates on existing notes that were reconfirmed and add new notes for the health concerns and the preference for single-exercise introduction.

REASONING: The user provided several new pieces of information. The doctor recommended becoming more active due to concerns about bone density and balance, which is a new goal. The user specified their available equipment: a pair of small weights and a chair. They also clarified that the doctor gave no specific movement restrictions. A significant point was the user finding the initial workout 'overwhelming' and expressing concern about back safety with the Romanian Deadlift, indicating a preference for simpler, safer, and less complex movements. Finally, the user's name, Margaret, was revealed. I have combined related preferences for simplicity and safety. The existing 'Prefers to train at home' note is reconfirmed by the context.

REASONING: The user revealed several new pieces of information. Their doctor advised them to be more active, specifically for bone density and balance, which forms their primary goal. They have no equipment at home, confirming their preference for home workouts but clarifying the setup. The user also indicated no specific doctor restrictions but needs to be careful and is currently feeling stiff. Finally, the user's name is Margaret. I've recategorized the 'beginner' note from 'profile' to 'general' as 'profile' is not an allowed category. I've combined the doctor's advice into a single goal note.

REASONING: The user mentioned having shoulder surgery 6 months ago and being cleared by their PT with no restrictions. This is a significant medical history detail that should be recorded as an 'injury' note, indicating past injury but current clearance. The conversation also revealed a sensitivity or caution regarding certain exercises (dumbbell flys) due to this history, which points to a preference for stable movements. This can be combined into one note about the shoulder history and current clearance, implying the need for careful exercise selection. The preference for a push day is a short-term plan, not a long-term preference to be stored.

REASONING: The user confirmed their preference for training at home and specified their available equipment as bodyweight and furniture.

The user asking about a 'glute bridge' reinforces their beginner status, so the existing beginner note remains relevant.

REASONING: The user explicitly stated their goal to "get bigger", which is muscle hypertrophy. They expressed a preference for "chest and arms maybe? the usual stuff.", which indicates a preference for classic chest and arm workouts. They confirmed they have no injuries. The user also demonstrated understanding and acceptance of RIR (Reps in Reserve) and progressive overload, stating they will "pick a weight where the last few reps are hard" and "lift heavier over time." These indicate their preferred training methodology. The existing notes about being a beginner and gym preference are confirmed and remain relevant. I will recategorize 'profile' to 'general'.

REASONING: The user indicated they are planning a 'Push day' for tomorrow, focusing on Chest, Shoulders, and Triceps. This is a near-term plan. The user also expressed a desire to improve their bench press, which is a current training focus. Finally, they requested to swap the barbell for dumbbells for the bench press, indicating a preference for this exercise for the current session or generally.

The existing notes are still valid and were not contradicted, so their dates should be updated. The profile note about experience is better categorized as 'general' rather than having no explicit category or a less fitting one.

REASONING: The user expressed a general goal of 'getting healthier' and 'feeling better'. They also revealed specific health concerns: 'bone density, balance' as advised by their doctor. Finally, they clarified their equipment situation, stating 'Nothing really. Just my living room.', which reconfirms and elaborates on their preference to train at home. I will add notes for the goal, injury, and specific equipment. The existing preference note 'Prefers to train at home' is reconfirmed by the 'living room only' statement, so its date will be updated.

[2026-01-31T22:42:19.104361] FULL EXTRACTION: User ed35ab63-a6f0-420c-be4d-edfc9ad0a2f8, Conv 08e878c6-790f-408d-b9cf-9f108cfb553c
REASONING: The user confirmed they prefer to train at home and specified they only have bodyweight equipment. They also stated their goal is to get healthier, with a specific focus on bone density and balance as advised by their doctor, and that the doctor gave no specific restrictions other than 'move more'. I will update the 'prefers to train at home' note's date, add a new note about equipment, and combine the health, bone density, and balance goals into a single 'goal' note. I will also add a 'general' note about the doctor's advice on restrictions. The 'beginner' note remains as it was not reconfirmed but is still relevant, and I will recategorize it from 'profile' to 'general'.
