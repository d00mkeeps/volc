ASSISTANT: Evening, Brian. I can help plan your next session or analyze your training.
BRIAN: Back and knees.
ASSISTANT: Got it. To make sure I build the best plan, are your back and knees areas you want to train, or are they something I should be cautious about?
BRIAN: No restrictions.
ASSISTANT: Perfect. Let's get to work on a session for your back and legs.
