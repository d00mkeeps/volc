ASSISTANT: Hey Jake, good evening! Want to prep for tomorrow or check your recent progress?
JAKE: let's prep for tomorrow
ASSISTANT: I'd love to get you ready for tomorrow. What would you like to train, and are there any injuries or restrictions I should know about?
JAKE: I just wanna build muscle. Nah, no injuries.
ASSISTANT: Perfect, let's focus on building muscle. What muscle groups are we hitting tomorrow?
JAKE: push day. chest, shoulders, triceps.
ASSISTANT: Sounds like a classic [push movement](glossary://10b2962d-7aa0-4cc3-a8c7-ceab316dcca0) day, I've built a session for you with a mix of [compound exercise](glossary://57ceea4d-5f6a-4897-88fb-ad0348faa889) and [isolation exercise](glossary://603007ea-3cfa-42d8-8199-a77212e14b32) to get you started.

Here's your workout, Jake. Let me know how it goes!

JAKE: Only 20kg for bench? I can def do more.
ASSISTANT: Of course! Those weights are just estimates until I learn your strength levels, so you should absolutely adjust them. Aim for a weight that's challenging for the target [reps](glossary://6db20df3-c386-44b6-9dc3-e29455f33819) but leaves you with about 2 reps in reserve ([RIR](glossary://7708f857-f349-470e-9423-d83c328ea542)).
JAKE: ok got it. so go heavy but not all out.
ASSISTANT: Exactly! You want to challenge yourself but always maintain good [form](glossary://36449c1d-d521-4b99-a316-c9de0340e69d). Do you have any other questions about the workout?
JAKE: nah, looks good. i'll try it.
ASSISTANT: Awesome! Go get after it, and let me know how the session feels once you're done.
JAKE: APPROVE
