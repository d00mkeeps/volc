ASSISTANT: Evening, Sarah. I can help plan your next session or analyze your training.
SARAH: Shoulder surgery 6 months ago.
ASSISTANT: Thanks for sharing that with me. Has a doctor or physical therapist cleared you for exercise, and are there any specific movements you've been told to avoid?
SARAH: Cleared by my PT. No restrictions now.
ASSISTANT: Excellent, that's great to hear. I'll be sure to choose stable and supportive exercises to keep that shoulder happy. What did you have in mind for today's workout?
SARAH: I'd like to do an upper body workout.
ASSISTANT: Of course. Here is a balanced upper body workout, Sarah. I've picked stable [compound exercise](glossary://57ceea4d-5f6a-4897-88fb-ad0348faa889)s to build strength safely around your shoulder.
