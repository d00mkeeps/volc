ASSISTANT: Hey Sarah, good evening! Want to prep for tomorrow or check your recent progress?
SARAH: Prep for tomorrow.
ASSISTANT: Let's get you ready for tomorrow! What are we thinking of training?
SARAH: Let's do an upper body day.
ASSISTANT: Sounds great! Any injuries or restrictions I should be aware of?
SARAH: Had shoulder surgery 6 months ago, but no restrictions.
ASSISTANT: Got it. We'll stick to some stable movements to keep that shoulder happy. Does a mix of chest, back, and arm exercises sound good?
SARAH: Sounds good.
ASSISTANT: Excellent. Here is a solid upper body session for you, Sarah. We'll start with some bigger [compound exercise](glossary://57ceea4d-5f6a-4897-88fb-ad0348faa889)s and finish with [isolation exercise](glossary://603007ea-3cfa-42d8-8199-a77212e14b32)s.
