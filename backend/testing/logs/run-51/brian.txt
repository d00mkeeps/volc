ASSISTANT: Evening, Brian. Want to plan tomorrow's session or review something?
BRIAN: plan tomorrow
ASSISTANT: What are we hitting tomorrow?
BRIAN: lower body day
ASSISTANT: Got it. Any injuries or restrictions I should know about?
BRIAN: disc herniation L4-L5 from years ago. mostly managed now
ASSISTANT: Thanks for sharing. What movements aggravate it?
BRIAN: heavy loaded flexion. conventional deadlifts are out
ASSISTANT: Makes sense. What have you been doing for hip hinge patterns?
BRIAN: trap bar and RDLs mostly. rack pulls sometimes
ASSISTANT: Solid choices. What time do you usually train?
BRIAN: 5am before work. only slot that works
ASSISTANT: Early bird. How's energy and warmup at that hour?
BRIAN: takes longer to warm up. need extra mobility work
ASSISTANT: Got it. What's your current weekly split look like?
BRIAN: 4 day upper lower. been running it for years
ASSISTANT: Classic setup. Any specific goals right now?
BRIAN: masters competition in March. need to peak squat
ASSISTANT: Exciting! What equipment do you use for heavy squats?
BRIAN: always belt up for working sets. helps brace with the back
ASSISTANT: Smart. Any knee considerations?
BRIAN: bit of wear and tear. wraps help on heavy days
ASSISTANT: Understood. For tomorrow, squat focus or accessories?
BRIAN: squat and some leg press. keep it simple
ASSISTANT: How many working sets do you typically do for squat?
BRIAN: 4-5 sets. RPE 7-8 range this far out
ASSISTANT: Makes sense for this phase. What's your target weight for tomorrow?
BRIAN: probably around 140kg for triples
ASSISTANT: Perfect. Want me to put together the session?
BRIAN: actually wait, one question about warmup
ASSISTANT: Sure, what's on your mind regarding the warmup?
BRIAN: should I do foam rolling first?
ASSISTANT: For your back history, some targeted glute rolling can help. Just avoid rolling the lower back directly. Want me to add that?
BRIAN: yeah add that in
ASSISTANT: Done. Anything else for the knee sleeves? When do you put them on?
ASSISTANT: Good afternoon, Brian. Need help planning a session or reviewing your training?
BRIAN: before my working sets on squat.
ASSISTANT: Got it. I'll add a note for glute foam rolling and putting on sleeves before your working sets. Ready to build out the full squat session now?
BRIAN: yes. need to get some work in on my cleans too.
ASSISTANT: Got it. We'll structure it with cleans for power, then move to your heavy squats. Does that sound like a plan?
BRIAN: QUIT
