ASSISTANT: Hey Jake, good evening! Want to prep for tomorrow or check your recent progress?
JAKE: prep for tomorrow. wanna get bigger.
ASSISTANT: Sounds like a plan! To get bigger, we want to focus on building muscle.

What muscle groups are we hitting tomorrow?
JAKE: Let's do chest and arms.
ASSISTANT: Awesome, a classic chest and arms day. Before I build your workout, do you have any injuries or restrictions I should be aware of?
JAKE: nah i'm good. ready to go.
ASSISTANT: Perfect. Here is a solid chest and arms workout to get you started on that goal.

Focus on controlling the weight and feeling the right muscles work, Jake.

JAKE: This weight seems really light. Can't I go heavier?
ASSISTANT: Of course! Those are just starting weights since this is our first workout together.

Go heavier, but aim to finish your last [set](glossary://e0d2db37-5a81-4d28-bc42-c1910310730f) feeling like you could only do 2-3 more [reps](glossary://6db20df3-c386-44b6-9dc3-e29455f33819) with good [form](glossary://36449c1d-d521-4b99-a316-c9de0340e69d).
JAKE: APPROVE
