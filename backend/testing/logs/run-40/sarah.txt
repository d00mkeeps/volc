ASSISTANT: Hey Sarah, good evening! Want to prep for tomorrow or check your recent progress?
SARAH: Let's plan for tomorrow.
ASSISTANT: Sounds great! What are we thinking of training tomorrow?
SARAH: I was thinking an upper body day.
ASSISTANT: Love it, a classic upper body day. Any injuries or restrictions I should work around?
SARAH: No restrictions now.
ASSISTANT: Perfect. I've put together a solid upper body session for you, Sarah, with a mix of [compound exercise](glossary://57ceea4d-5f6a-4897-88fb-ad0348faa889) and [isolation exercise](glossary://603007ea-3cfa-42d8-8199-a77212e14b32) work. Let me know what you think.
