    Fetch exercises targeting specific muscle groups from the exercise database.
    
    Use this tool when creating workout plans to get relevant exercise options.
    Call this once you understand the user's goals and target muscle groups.
    
    When modifying workouts, use the exercises already available in your context.
    Only call the exercise tool again if the user requests muscle groups you haven't 
    fetched yet (e.g., if they want to add legs to a chest workout).
    
    Args:
        muscle_groups: Target muscle groups (e.g. ['chest', 'triceps', 'shoulders']).
                      Valid: chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, lats, traps,
                      quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, abs, obliques, forearms,
                      abductors, adductors, hip_flexors, lower_back, cardiovascular_system
        
        base_movement: (Optional) Filter by movement type. 
                      Valid: ab_wheel, back_extension, bench_press, bicep_curl, 
                      bulgarian_split_squat, calf_raise, chest_fly, crunch, deadlift,

                      Use 'mobility' for stretches, mobility work, and warm-up movements.

        experience_level: (Optional) Filter by difficulty - 'beginner', 'intermediate', 'advanced'

        - All chest exercises: get_exercises_by_muscle_groups(['chest'])
        - Only bench press variations: get_exercises_by_muscle_groups(['chest'], base_movement='bench_press')
