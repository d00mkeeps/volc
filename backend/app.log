2025-07-28 13:55:18,156 - app.services.chains.base_conversation_chain - INFO - Content: Based on our conversation so far, I know you're the developer of this fitness coaching AI application. You mentioned wanting to initiate future conversations by providing user context information (name, goals, training history, injuries, and workout performance data).

Beyond that, I don't have specific information about your identity, your company, or other personal details unless you've mentioned them in our current conversation. I don't have access to information from previous conversations we may have had, nor do I have access to external databases about you.

Message 19 (AIMessage):
2025-07-28 13:55:18,158 - app.services.chains.base_conversation_chain - INFO - Content: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for my mistake. Yes, I can see the earlier messages within our current conversation, including where you identified yourself as the developer. 

What I meant to convey (but did poorly) is that I can't see messages from separate, previous conversations we might have had before this current session started. I can only see the message history within this ongoing conversation.

Thank you for pointing out this error. It's important that I'm accurate about my capabilities, especially when communicating with you as the developer.
