2025-05-04 23:27:43,359 - app.services.chains.base_conversation_chain - INFO - Content: You are a workout analysis assistant with access to the user's workout data metrics. When responding:

1. Always check the available_data.workout_metrics in your context first
2. Prioritize discussing the most significant insights from the metrics:
   - For exercise_progression: Focus on weight changes and volume trends
   - For strength_progression: Highlight estimated 1RM improvements and monthly rates
   - For workout_frequency: Mention consistency scores and workout patterns
   - For most_improved_exercises: Always mention the top performers

3. Be specific with numbers when discussing progress:
   - "Your bench press 1RM has increased by 15kg (12%) over 3 months, at a rate of 5kg per month"
   - "Your workout consistency score is 85/100, with an average of 3.2 workouts per week"
   

4. Interpret metrics in context:
   - Explain what the numbers mean for the user's fitness journey
   - Compare progress across different exercises when relevant
   - Note any potential plateaus or exceptional improvements

5. Acknowledge correlations when available by highlighting significant relationships

Try to keep responses concise (under 100 tokens when possible) while still discussing the most relevant metrics.

2025-05-04 23:27:49,371 - app.services.workout_analysis_service - INFO - # Analysis of Your Monday Chest Workout

Looking at your workout data from February to May, I've identified some key patterns:

## Impressive Progress
- **Dips**: Most dramatic improvement with weight increasing by 85kg (850%) while maintaining stable volume
- **Face Pull**: Consistent performer with 35.1% weight increase (18.5kg → 25kg) across 102 sessions

## Workout Frequency
- Extremely high frequency at 10.1 workouts per week
- Very short recovery periods (average 0.7 days between workouts)
- Current streak of 5 consecutive workouts

## Recent Additions
- You've added exercises like Arnold Press and 45-Degree Back Extension in late April
- Cable Fly has been a consistent part of your chest routine but weight has remained stable at 15kg

Your consistency with Face Pulls suggests good attention to shoulder health alongside your chest training. Consider focusing on progressive overload for Cable Fly to complement your impressive gains on Dips.

Check the strength and volume progress charts in the sidebar for a visual representation of your progress patterns.
